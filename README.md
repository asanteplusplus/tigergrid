Tigergrid is an open source microgrid modeling software that allows users to select a combination of Solar PV, Wind Turbine, Battery and Generator. Tigergrid includes load profiles obtained from the OpenEI database, which can be mapped to any geographical location using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification. The simulation results allows for plots of the Global Horizontal Radiation and Wind speed at the selected location to be plotted.
